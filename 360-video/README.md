## Unity - 360 Video Viewer

Technical Description

This project is structured to give you hands-on experience in various critical aspects of 360-degree video integration in VR:

1 - Video Integration

Learn the ins and outs of importing 360-degree videos into Unity. Understand the nuances of various video formats and their playback implications in VR.

2 - 360 Video Playback System

Implement a robust video playback system using Unity’s Video Player component. Create intuitive controls for play, pause, stop, and video seeking.

3 - User Interface for Video Control

Design and implement a VR-friendly user interface. Explore and implement various control options like gaze-based, hand-controller-based, or virtual “laser pointer” systems for user interaction.

4 - Transitions and Additional Features

Go beyond basic playback by implementing smooth transitions between videos and adding optional features like spatial audio, aiming to create a fully immersive 360-degree video experience.

5 - Comprehensive Documentation

Document your development process, from video selection to feature implementation, providing a clear guide for others to follow.

6 - Final Build and Testing

Bring it all together with a final compilation of your project, conducting extensive tests on a VR platform to ensure performance and user experience.

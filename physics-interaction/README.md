Technical Description

This project focuses on several pivotal aspects of VR video integration:

1 - Multi-Point Object Grabbing and Handling

Develop a system for users to realistically grab and manipulate objects at multiple points, utilizing physics joints and constraints.

2 - Realistic Object Throwing Mechanics

Craft a mechanism for throwing objects that factors in weight, size, and user-applied force, using VR controller data for trajectory calculations.

3 - Stacking and Balancing Objects

Create scenarios for stacking and balancing objects, focusing on accurate physical properties like mass, friction, and gravity.

4 - Distance Selection and Grabbing

Implement a system for selecting and grabbing objects from a distance, exploring mechanics like force grab or laser pointer interactions.

5 - Additional Physics-Based Interactions

Experiment with various other physics-based interactions such as collisions, levers, elastic objects, and pressure-based mechanisms.

6 - Testing and Refinement

Test the interaction systems for realism and responsiveness, and refine based on feedback. Discuss and implement optimization techniques to maintain performance in VR, considering the impact of physics calculations.
